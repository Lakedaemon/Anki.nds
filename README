Anki.nds V1.1 allows you to review cards on a Nintendo Ds and 
to keep in sync with your Anki decks on your main comp, 
wherevere you are (as long as you can connect to a wifi access point).

Anki.nds is maintained by Olivier Binda (olivier.binda@wanadoo.fr) 
and hosted at http://github.com/Lakedaemon/Anki.nds
It is a fork of ankidssync (r6) originally written by Jake Probst (http://digital-haze.net/ankidssync.php)

It brings a few additional features : 

1) Customizable conf file to allow the connection to hotspots with webportal ssl authentification (FreeWifi, Neuf, ...)
2) Better import of Anki cards (with new/failed/review cards respecting the Anki settings and shedule)
3) Possibility to insert cards between Cards sharing the same factid.
4) Saner keys during review
5) Sync without wifi from inside Anki (with NoWifi-AnkiSync.py)

Setup : 

1) move the Anki.nds directory that is in your Anki plugin directory to the root of your nintendo ds filesystem.
2) With a text editor, modify the settings in Anki.nds/Anki.conf 
(there are comments & explanations)

optional) if you plan to only use wifi sync, disable NoWifi-AnkiSync. 
Inside Anki, you set up that in the menu Setings/Plugins/Startup)

Don't change the name of the directory "Anki.nds" and put it at the root of your ds filesystem or 
you'll have a chance to see a Guru meditate.

To Do list : 

0) Remotely command Anki (to browse other decks to sync) 
1) Implement srs features (less urgent now that more free wifi hotspots are available)
2) Stream Stats/Card Info from Anki
3) Implement Info Screens in Anki.nds (to display stats/card/info)
4) Overhaul Anki.nds Graphic Engine
5) ship other libs with the source of Anki.nds
6) Implement touchscreen browsing for people with RSI
