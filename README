The Anki.nds project is a fork of ankidssync (r6) written by Jake Probst 
see http://digital-haze.net/ankidssync.php

It brings a few additional features : 

1) Customizable conf file to allow the connection to hotspots with webportal ssl authentification (FreeWifi, Neuf, ...)
2) Better import of Anki cards (with new/failed/review cards respecting the Anki settings and shedule)
3) Possibility to insert cards between Cards sharing the same factid.
4) Saner keys during review
5) Sync without wifi from inside Anki (with NoWifi-AnkiSync.py)

To Do list : 

0) Remotely command Anki (to browse other decks to sync) 
1) Implement srs features (less urgent now that more free wifi hotspots are available)
2) Stream Stats/Card Info from Anki
3) Implement Info Screens in Anki.nds (to display stats/card/info)
4) Overhaul Anki.nds Graphic Engine
5) ship other libs with the source of Anki.nds
6) Implement touchscreen browsing for people with RSI
